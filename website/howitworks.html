<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The FMACJ Parallelization Framework is made in a way that keeps
<code>System.Threading</code> away from you. Usually programmers tried to 
manually start Threads to make their program use multiple cores. Whereas this 
is okay for simple programs it is most likely the shortest way to lock hell
when used in complex applications. However, with FMACJ you don't have to think 
about threads at all and data is exchanged via thread-safe channels so locks 
are not needed in your code.</p>  
<h3>The Concept</h3>
<p>Take a look at the following Image: </p>
<div style="text-align:center;"> 
	<img src="images/howitworks_concept.png" alt="How it works: The Concept" />
</div>
<p>The different colors denote different threads. The blue and green threads
fork from the main thread. They send their results through two different
channels. When data is available on both channels, the purple thread can
do calculations that depend on data from both of the first two threads. Whereas
methods usually pass control around by calling each other, here they're sending
<em>data</em> to each other and run independently. However, you do
not have to do the data exchange manually. You just have to code as you are used
to and leave a few gaps where FMACJ can jump in and break the control flow chain 
to put in thread calls and everything that's needed for proper data flow.</p>
<h3>Parallelizing your assembly</h3>
<p>However, there are are some specialities that you have to keep in mind while
programming. The most important thing to know is, how your code is turned into
a parallelized version. This is done by a class called 
<code>ParallelizationFactory</code> that creates dynamic assamblies containing
classes that are derived from your classes and fills them with everything that
is needed for parallelization. Then you can get an instance of that class from
the factory that looks just like yours (due to derivation) but that behaves
in a parallelized way. Here's the part of the simple hello world program from
the <a href="index.html">welcome page</a> where these initialization steps are done:</p>
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre><span class="lnum">  12:  </span>      <strong>ParallelizationFactory</strong></pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">  13:  </span>        <strong>.Parallelize</strong>(<span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(Program).Assembly);</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">  14:  </span>      </pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">  15:  </span>      Program parallelized = <strong>ParallelizationFactory</strong></pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">  16:  </span>                              <strong>.GetParallelized</strong>&lt;Program&gt;();</pre>
</div>
<p>The first step is to give your assembly to the factory where it is analyzed
and parallelized types are created according to your attributes. Then in 
step two you can get a parallelized instance of your class by calling the
<code>GetParallelized</code> method.</p>
<p>In order to parallelize your code there are some things you must do
so that <code>ParallelizationFactory</code> knows what to do:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Mark your class with the <code>[Parallelizable]</code> attribute.
 This indicates that you want your class to be parallelized.</li>
 <li>Make your class implement <code>IParallelizable</code>. This is
 necessary so that you can call <code>GetParallelized</code>
 for your type.</li>
 <li>Make your class <em>abstract</em>. This is because in most scenarios you will
 need abstract methods in your class where FMACJ can implement
 parallelization behavior. <code>ParallelizationFactory</code> won't
 parallelize non-abstract types. This also prevents unintended use of
 non-parallelized instances.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Forks</h3>
<p>This is the method from the example which is executed in a parallelized way:</p>
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre><span class="lnum">  24:  </span>    <strong>[Fork]</strong></pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">  25:  </span>    <strong>[Asynchronous]</strong></pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">  26:  </span>    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd"><em>virtual</em></span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SayHello()</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">  27:  </span>    {</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">  28:  </span>      Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Hello from Thread {0}"</span>, </pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">  29:  </span>        System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">  30:  </span>    }</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">  31:  </span>  }</pre>
</div>
<p>The method is marked with the <code>[Asynchronous]</code> attribute.
This means that the calling thread should continue without waiting
until the execution of the called method is finished. Logically, the method
must have <code>void</code> return type.</p>
<p>When <code>ParallelizationFactory</code> finds a <code>virtual</code>
method marked with <code>[Fork]</code> and <code>[Asynchronous]</code>
 it overrides it in the parallelized version and fills in the code that 
 calls your original implementation in a seperate thread pool thread.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"> 
	<img src="images/howitworks_fork.png" alt="How it works: Fork" />
</div>
<p>However, this approach has a major disadvantage: the asynchronous method
does not return a value so the only way to handle a computed result would be
writing to a field which is a major problem, not only because you might
need a lock, but because the time when the result is available cannot be
determined. The solution to these issues looks like this:<p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre><span class="lnum">   1:  </span><strong>[Fork]</strong></pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   2:  </span><span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd"><em>abstract</em></span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SomeMethod(<span class="kwrd">int</span> parameter);</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   3:  </span><strong>[Asynchronous]</strong></pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   4:  </span><span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SomeMethod(<span class="kwrd">int</span> parameter,</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   5:  </span>  <strong>[Channel(<span class="str">"result"</span>)]</strong> <span class="kwrd">out</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> result)</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   6:  </span>{</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   7:  </span>  result = SomeComplicatedOperation(parameter);</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   8:  </span>}</pre>
</div>
<p>
As you can see, the method has now been split into two methods. The first
one is <code>abstract</code> and marked with <code>Fork</code>. This is where 
FMACJ performs the override. The <code>[Asynchronous]</code> method contains 
your actual implementation and is called by the overriden <code>Fork</code>
method. Both methods have the same signature except for the parameters marked
with the <code>[Channel]</code> attribute in the asynchronous method. This is
how <code>ParallelizationFactory</code> recognizes that the two methods belong
together. The channel parameters are out parameters. They are where all your
results go. The overriden implementation of the fork method handles them and
enqueues them to the corresponding channel.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"> 
	<img src="images/howitworks_fork_with_channels.png" 
	alt="How it works: Fork with Channels" />
</div>
<h3>Channels</h3>
<p>Channels are the objects used for communication between parallelized methods.
They work like thread-safe queues and have an <code>EventWaitHandle</code> that
can be used to induce further processing of the values as soon as they arrive
or to make a join that makes the current thread wait for a result. However,
you don't have to worry about those details because FMACJ does all the work
for you. You just have to use the <code>[Channel]</code> attribute on your
parameters and FMACJ generates the channel object and does all the result
enqueuing and wait handle registering internally. However, you must name your
channels so that FMACJ knows what you want to belong together. This is done by
specifying the name in the channel attribute: <code>[Channel("name")]</code></p>
<h3>Chords</h3>
<p>Chords are asynchronous methods that are not directly called by your code.
Therefore they do not accept ordinary parameters but only channels as described
above. When a value is available on every channel used by the chord, FMACJ
automatically invokes it. The following chord would be executed whenever there
is a value available on each of the channels "value1" and "value2":</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre><span class="lnum">   1:  </span><strong>[Chord]</strong></pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   2:  </span><span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SomeChord(</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   3:  </span>  [Channel(<span class="str">"value1"</span>)] <span class="kwrd">int</span> value1,</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   4:  </span>  [Channel(<span class="str">"value2"</span>)] <span class="kwrd">int</span> value2)</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   5:  </span>{</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   6:  </span>  ...</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   7:  </span>}</pre>
</div>
<h3>Joins</h3>
<p>The chord as described in the previous section has the same disadvantage
that asynchronous methods had before the introduction of channels. The result
of any computation cannot easily be passed on. That's where the
<code>[Join]</code> attribute is used. A join is a method called by your code
(in most cases from the main thread) that waits for a parallel computation to
complete and then returns the result which is calculated by a chord. Chords
can return values now:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre><span class="lnum">   1:  </span>[Chord]</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   2:  </span><span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd"><strong>int</strong></span> CalculateSomething(</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   3:  </span>  [Channel(<span class="str">"value1"</span>)] <span class="kwrd">int</span> value1,</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   4:  </span>  [Channel(<span class="str">"value2"</span>)] <span class="kwrd">int</span> value2)</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   5:  </span>{</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   6:  </span>  <span class="kwrd">return</span> SomeComplicatedOperation(value1, value2);</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   7:  </span>}</pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   8:  </span><strong>[Join]</strong></pre>
<pre><span class="lnum">   9:  </span><span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd"><em>abstract</em></span> <span class="kwrd"><strong>int</strong></span> CalculateSomething();</pre>
</div>
<p>The concept behind this is the same as with <code>[Fork]</code> and
<code>[Asynchronous]</code>: The methods are recognized as a group due to the
fact that their signatures are the same when you take away all channel
parameters. The <code>[Join]</code> method is automatically implemented by
FMACJ. If you call it the current thread will block until the corresponding
chord had been executed once and a result has been retrieved.</p>
